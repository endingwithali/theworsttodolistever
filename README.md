# Welcome to the worst to do list ever

This to do list is a learning project for @endingwithali to get stronger at the brass tacks of coding in GOLANG! 


She is working on it live on her Twitch Channel - you can find it at [twitch.tv/endingwithali](twitch.tv/endingwithali)

The premise was simple 
```
- NO LOGIN
- JUST ONE LIST
- EVERYONE SHARES LIST

```

Here's the working plan:
```
backend: golang + gin
frontend: javascript + HTMX
DB: POSTGRES
```
